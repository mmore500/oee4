Biotic selection, the emergent interplay between evolutionary processes and environmental effects driven by evolved traits, is broadly considered essential to the diversity and sophistication characteristic of biological life.
For this reason, substantial interest exists as to how changes in novelty, complexity, and adaptation unfold along lineages under selection driven by freeform, localized biotic interactions.

To explore these topics, we examine a detailed evolutionary history encompassing two sequential morphological novelties, drawn from a digital multicell model incorporating extensive biotic interactions.

We find the establishment of an asymmetrical cigar patterning among multicells to be accompanied by moderate increases in both genetic complexity and fitness, as well as a substantial spike in phenotypic complexity.
However, a later introduction of coordinated bursts in outwards growth is accompanied by none of these effects.
% In a subsequent episode, a genome expansion drove strong fitness increase, but no notable changes in morphology or any complexity measures.
% Furthermore, strongest fitness effects are associated with no changes in genetic or phenotypic complexity --- although a notable later adaptive increase in genome size is observed.
Confirming the presence of biotic selection, we find some competition outcomes to reverse based on background presence of other evolved lineages.
Surprisingly, through, in one case we observe this effect associated with a sharp decrease in complexity and a loss multicell patterning.
% Furthermore, late in evolutionary history, we see a sudden increase in genome size with strong fitness advantage but no apparent changes in complexity or life history.

Instead, possibly indicative of a robustness tradeoff or a potentiating relationship, increases in genetic complexity are significantly associated with subsequent fitness gains.

% In this case study, we describe ten qualitatively distinct multicellular morphologies, several of which exhibit asymmetrical growth and distinct life stages.
