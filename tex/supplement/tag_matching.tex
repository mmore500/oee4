\section{Tag Matching}

We use 64-bit bitstring tags to label modules and jump destinations.
We use a variant of Downing's streak metric to compute tag matches \citep{downing2015intelligence}.
We deterministically select the single best-matching result for a tag lookup.
If there is a tie, an arbitrary result is selected.
For module-lookup, the best-matching tag must have a match quality at the 80th or better percentile among match qualities of pairs of randomly generated tags.
Otherwise, no module is activated.
For jump-lookup, the best match must be at the 50th or better percentile.
Otherwise, no jump is performed.
