\caption{Interpolated fitness complexity.
Estimated number of non-critical sites that contribute to fitness.
Vertical gray lines represent stints with missing estimates due to bad phenotype-neutral nopouts.
Shaded areas represent 95\% confidence intervals.
Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:fitness_complexity_alt:interpolated_fitness_complexity_alt} shows the same data with smaller markers.
