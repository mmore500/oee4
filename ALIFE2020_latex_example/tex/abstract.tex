The notion of open-endedness is characterized by the tangled relationship of novelty, functional complexity, and adaptation.
The mechanisms by which and the extent to which these ideas relate to one another remains an open question.
In this work, we apply existing methods and philosophy to describe the evolution of these qualities in a case study of a simulation system designed to study digital multicellularity.
In this case study, we describe ten qualitatively distinct multicellular morphologies among a hundred sampled specimen.
We contextualize the evolutionary history these morphologies with measurements of complexity and adaptation.
Our case study suggests a loose, sometimes divergent, relationship between these threads of novelty, complexity, and adaptation.
