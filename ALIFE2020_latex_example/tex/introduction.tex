\section{Introduction}

The challenge, and promise, of open-ended evolution has animated decades of inquiry and discussion within the artificial life community \citep{packard2019overview}.
The difficulty of devising models that produce characteristic outcomes of open-ended evolution suggests profound philosophical or scientific blind spots in our understanding of the natural processes that gave rise to contemporary organisms and ecosystems.
Already, pursuit of open-ended evolution has yielded paradigm-shifting insights.
For example, novelty search demonstrated how processes promoting non-adaptive diversification can ultimately yield adaptive outcomes that were previously unattainable \citep{lehman2011abandoning}. 
Such work lends insight to fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, such as the relevance — or irrelevance – of natural selection with respect to increases in complexity \citep{lehman2012evolution, Lynch8597} and the origins of evolvability \citep{lehman2013evolvability,Kirschner8420}. Evolutionary algorithms devised in support of open-ended evolution models also promise to deliver tangible broader impacts for society. Possibilities include the generative design of engineering solutions, consumer products, art, video games, and AI systems \citep{nguyen2015,stanley2017open}.

Preceding decades have witnessed advances toward defining — quantitatively and philosophically — the concept of open-ended evolution \citep{lehman2012beyond,dolson2019modes,bedau1998classification} as well as investigating causal phenomena that promote open-ended dynamics such as ecological dynamics, selection, and evolvability \citep{dolson2019constructive,soros2014identifying,huizinga2018emergence}.

The concept of open-endedness is fundamentally characterized by intertwined ideas of novelty, functional complexity, and adaptation \citep{taylor2016open}.
The mechanisms by which and the extent to which these ideas relate to one another remains an open question.
In this work, we apply existing methods and philosophy to describe the evolution of these qualities in a case study of a simulation system designed to study digital multicellularity.
