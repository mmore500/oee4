\subsection{Decay to Baseline Service}

scheduled every $i$th update

Decay's a cell's global regulators, resets its controller-mapped peripheral states, and resets its transient NOP states.

\subsection{Running Log Purge Service}

every $i$th update

Purges a cell's running logs.

\subsection{Controller Mapped State Noise Service}

every $i$th update

Given a non-zero controller-mapped state defect rate, picks a random number $n$ from a Poisson distribution.
Then, it introduces $n$ defects to a cell's controller-mapped state.
These defects have a 50\% probability of zeroing out the state, and a 50\% probability of randimizing it.

\subsection{Interpreted Introspective State Refresh Service}

every $i$th update

Refreshes the Interpreted Introspective state of a cell.

\subsection{Extrospective State Exchange Service}

every $i$th update


\subsection{Extrospective State Rotate Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Introspective State Exchange Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Introspective State Rotate Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Cpu Execution Service}

every $i$th update

Executes a cell's cardinal's genomes in random order.

\subsection{Event Launching Service}

every $i$th update

Launches a cell's events, and then launches all of its cardinals' events.

\subsection{Introspective State Rotate Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Introspective State Exchange Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Extrospective State Rotate Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Extrospective State Exchange Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Writable State Exchange Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Writable State Rotate Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Birth Setup Service}

every $i$th update

Births a new cell into the current cell.

This occurs by first iterating through the cell's cardinals' birth request inputs in random order.
While the cell's resource stockpile is sufficiently large (greater than the Spawn Defense Cost), the requests are ignored and the stockpile depleted by the cost.
The first request that cannot be defended against is then acted upon.
The current cell's death routine is called, the old genome is replaced by the incoming genome, and the new cell's make-alive routine is called.

\subsection{Cell Age Service}

every $i$th update

Updates the cell age of every cell, and then refreshes their Kin Group epochs.

\subsection{Collective Harvesting Service}

every $i$th update

Calculates total amount of resource harvested among every cardinal, and then updates every cardinal with the new amount.

\subsection{Collective Resource Decay Service}

every $i$th update

Decays cell resource stockpile by an algorithmically-calucalted decay rate, and then updates every cardinal with the new amount.

\subsection{Conduit Flush Service}

every $i$th update

Flushes every cardinals' outputs.

\subsection{Inter Message Launching Service}

every $i$th update


\subsection{Inter Message Purging Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Message Counter Clear Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Quorum Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Resource Decay Service}

every $i$th update

Decays cell resource stockpile by an algorithmically-calucalted decay rate, and then updates every cardinal with the new amount.

\subsection{Resource Harvesting Service}

every $i$th update

Calculates total amount of resource harvested among every cardinal, and then updates every cardinal with the new amount.

\subsection{Resource Receiving Service}

every $i$th update

Calculates total amount of resource recieved across every cardinal, and then updates every cardinal with the new amount.

If the cell has died this update, it instead refunds all recieved resources.

\subsection{Resource Sending Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Spawn Sending Service}

every $i$th update

If available resource is greater than one, iterates randomly through every cardinal to determine whether it requested to spawn and not to arrest spawns.
Then, it sends one of these requests at random and decreases resource by one.

\subsection{State Input Jump Service}

every $i$th update

Calls jump on

\subsection{State Output Put Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Epoch Advance Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Writable State Rotate Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Writable State Exchange Restore Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Group Expiration Service}

every $i$th update

\subsection{Apoptosis Service}

Iterates through every cell checking whether any of its cardinals has requested apoptosis. If so, it calls its death routine.
