\subsection{Nop State ($4\times$)}

\texttt{float}

Writing to this state has no effect. Thus, it can be used to store data in-memory.

\subsection{Transient Nop State ($4\times$)}

\texttt{float}

Writing to this state has no effect, and it is cleared regularly.

\subsection{Apoptosis Request}

\texttt{char}

Whether cell has requested apoptosis.

\subsection{Heir Request}

\texttt{char}

Whether a cell is a heir (that is, it inherits resource on death).

\subsection{RepLev Request (0 thru $L$)}

\texttt{char}

\subsection{Resource Receive Resistance}

\texttt{float}

How resistant this cell should be to recieving resource.

\subsection{Resource Reserve Request}

\texttt{float}

Whether this cell has requested resource be reserved. The number stored indicates the amount of resource requested.

\subsection{Resource Send Limit}

\texttt{float}

Maximum amount of resource that this cell can send.

\subsection{Resource Send Request}

\texttt{float}

Whether a cardinal has requested to send resource. The number stored indicates the amount of resource.

\subsection{Spawn Arrest}

\texttt{char}

Whether a cardinal has requested to stop the spawning of children, even if sufficient resource is available.

\subsection{Spawn Request}
