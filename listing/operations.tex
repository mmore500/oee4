This section overviews the operation library made available to evolving signalgp-lite genetic programs within the simulation.

Within the program section of each genome, each instruction contained 
\begin{itemize}
\item an op code, specifying which operation should be performed;
\item a 64-bit bitstring, used as a tag for operations that required tag-matching or as data for some configurable operations; and
\item three integer arguments, specifying which registers the operation should apply to (many operations do not use all arguments).
\end{itemize}

In the operation descriptions below, we refer to register access via to the $n$th argument as \texttt{reg[arg\_n]}.
Each core has its own eight \texttt{float} registers.
All core registers are zeroed out at core launch.

In order to prevent bread-and-butter operations like global anchors, local anchors, and terminals from being swamped out by large instruction set size, we manually defined increased ``prevalences'' for some instructions.
This prevalence increased the probability of the operation being selected under mutations and initial program generation.
Prevalence works like increasing the number of identical copies of the operation included in the operation library.
We provide the prevalence of each operation below.

See \url{https://github.com/mmore500/dishtiny/tree/prq49/include/dish2/operations} for the source code of DISHTINY-specific operations and \url{https://github.com/mmore500/signalgp-lite/tree/b6c437f44136651aa6f4051d84bc62a86c2afbbe/include/sgpl/operations} for the source code of generic operations.

Refer to Section \ref{sec:virtual_cpu} for details on the virtual CPU running these instructions.

\subsection{Fork If}

\opdef{1}{1}

\subsection{Global Anchor} \label{sec:global_anchor}

\opdef{15}{0}

Marks a module-begin position.
Based on tag-lookup, new cores or global jump instructions may set the program counter to this instruction's program position.

This instruction can also mark a module-end position --- executing this instruction can terminate the executing core.
If no local anchor instruction is present between the current global anchor instruction and the preceding global anchor instruction, this operation will not terminate the executing core.
(This way, several global anchors may lead into the same module.)

However, if a local anchor instruction is present between the current global anchor instruction and the preceding global anchor instruction, this operation will terminate the executing core. 
Local jump instructions will only consider local anchors between the preceding global anchor and the subsequent global anchor instruction.
