\section{Introspective State}

Introspective state refers to the collection of simulation-generated sensor values that evolving programs running within each cardinal can access via read-only operations.
Each cardinal has an independent copy of each piece of introspective state state.
(However, some introspective states representing cell state are set to identical values across cardinals within the same cell.)

Each cardinal's introspective state regularly copied and dispatched to that cardinal's neighbor cell, where it serves as read-only extrospective state.

Introspective state is organized into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item raw introspective state, and
    \item interpreted introspective state.
\end{enumerate}

Raw introspective state directly exposes aspects of simulation state.
Interpreted introspective state is filled with truthy values that are interpreted as booleans to dispatch environmentally-managed events.

See \url{https://github.com/mmore500/dishtiny/tree/prq49/include/dish2/peripheral/readable_state/introspective_state} for source code implementing introspective state.
