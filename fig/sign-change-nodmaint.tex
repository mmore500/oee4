\textbf{Fitness trade-offs driven by ecological context, no diversity maintenance control.}
\footnotesize
Plots report influence on focal strain competition assays attributable to presence versus absence of background strain.
Experiments competed focal strain samples (specimen from stint $n+1$ against baseline focal strain population from stint $n$.
Outcomes recorded between $1$ (fitness gain; stint $n$ baseline driven extinct) and $-1$ (fitness loss; stint $n+1$ driven extinct), with near-zero values indicating comparable fitness.
Vertical line segments mark discrepancy between abiotic conditions (``without,'' hollow markers) and biotic conditions (filled markers).
Markers omitted where no significant significant fitness change detected between stint $n+1$ and stint $n$ baseline ($\alpha = 0.005$).
Segment color highlights sign-change effect: harmful trait becomes beneficial under ecological context (blue) or vice versa (red).
Subplots differ in source of ecological context (columns).
Under prefatory context, background strain from stint $n$; under contemporary context, stint $n+1$.
