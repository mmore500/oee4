    \textbf{Co-occurence of adaptation with genome expansion.}
    \footnotesize
    Violin plots compare adaptation assay outcome distributions between focal specimens with genome size increase relative to ancestor and those without.
    Assays compete focal specimen at stint $n+1$ against focal population at stint $n$;
    panels report outcomes under three assay designs, differing in biotic context.
    When competed in the presence of background strain population from stint $n+1$, stronger adaptation accompanies genome expansions --- with small effect size (panel \ref{fig:genome-expansion:contemporary}; $p = 0.013, \; \delta = 0.28$).
    When competed with no biotic background, a similar trend appears with small effect size appears under fitness assays without biotic background, although not significant under a two-tailed alternative hypothesis (panel \ref{fig:genome-expansion:without}; $p=0.08, \; \delta = 0.22$).
    By contrast, no effect is apparent under prefatory biotic background from stint $n$ (panel \ref{fig:genome-expansion:prefatory}).
    Reported statistics are Cliff's delta, a non-parametric effect size metric ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, and two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test; significance testing with two-sample $t$-tests (two-tailed alternative) gave similar results.
    Independent adaptation assays, conducted on focal specimens including biotic backgrounds without balancing procedures for diversity maintenance with background, gave corroborating results (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:genome-expansion-nodmaint}).
    Contemporary background assays exhibited significant adaptation-expansion  ($p=0.02, \; \delta=0.27$), but prefatory background assays did not ($p=0.32, \; \delta=0.12$).
    Further yet, consistent patterns arose in adaptation assays on whole focal strain populations (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:genome-expansion-population}).
    In this case, significant adaptation-expansion association arose with contemporary background ($p=0.03, \; \delta=0.25$);
    weaker associations, not significant under two-tailed alternative hypotheses, arose under prefatory and no biotic background ($\delta=0.20,\; 0.19$).
