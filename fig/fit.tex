\textbf{Adaptation assay design.}
\footnotesize
Due to the implicit nature of fitness in our study system, adaptation was primarily assessed on a relative basis, using competition experiments, rather than on an absolute basis.
Panel \ref{fig:fit-nobg} overviews competition experiment design.
For these experiments, population cells are seeded with genomes from two strains in equal proportion,
After a fixed simulation duration, strain abundances are assessed.
In stint-to-stint adaptation assays, ``winning'' (higher abundance) strain consistency across replicates determined outcome significance.
For genotype/phenotype complexity screens --- which required assessment of numerous knockout variants --- significance was instead assessed by comparing end-state abundance ratio against a sampled distribution of outcomes from control WT vs. WT competition replicates.
In some cases, to assess context-sensitivity of fitness, competitions were performed under ``biotic background'' conditions (panel \ref{fig:fit-bg}).
For these competition trials, half the initial population was seeded with a background strain.
Although the background strain participated fully during competition runtime, it was excluded from end-state abundance ratio calculations --- which considered only the test and baseline strains.
