\caption{
Point mutation distance between tag blocks from sampled focal strain representatives across stints.
These distances were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationship of sampled focal strain representatives.
Light white indicates high similarity between tag blocks and dark blue indicates low similarity.
Representatives from stints 0 and 1, which share no common ancestry with representatives from other stints, are excluded.
Only upper triangular data plotted.
