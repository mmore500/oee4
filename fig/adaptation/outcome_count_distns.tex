\caption{
Distributions of adaptation assay outcomes over all stints.
For each adaptation assay, three outcomes were possible: significant fitness gain, significant fitness loss, or no significant fitness change (``neutral'').
Significance cutoff $p < 0.005$ was used.
A fitness loss --- color coded red --- corresponds to winning 2 or fewer competitions out of 20 against the preceding stint's focal strain population.
A fitness gain --- color coded green --- corresponds to winning 18 or more competitions out of 20 against the preceding stint's focal strain population.
Neutral fitness outcomes are color coded yellow.
Outcome counts are accumulated over experiments from stint 1 through stint 100.
Upper row shows results for sampled focal strain genome, lower row shows results for entire focal strain population.
See Figure \ref{fig:adaptation_assay_cartoon} for explanation of competition biotic backgrounds.
See Figure \ref{fig:outcome_count_joint_distns} for joint distributions of fitness outcomes across biotic backgrounds.
